# ðŸŒµ Cactus

GitHub Action to create releases. It will create two pull requests.

## Pull Request into main

The first one goes into the default main development branch updating the versions in `/package-lock.json`, `/projects/{$project}/package.json` and `/projects/{$project}/CHANGELOG.md`.

In this example the release version would be `3.2289.0` and the new version `3.2290.0`. The topmost changelog's entry needs to be in a format like this:

```markdown
## [3.2289.0] - Unreleased

- Some changes here
- Other changes
```

The action will create:

```markdown
## [3.2290.0] - Unreleased

...

## [3.2289.0] - ${Date of Dispatch}

- Some changes here
- Other changes
```

## Pull Request into release

This pull request gives an overview about the current release.

With a release version of e.g. `3.2289.0`, it will be created from `rc/${project}/3.2289.0` into `release/${project}/3.2289`.

Both the `rc` and the `release` branch are forked from the default main development branch.

The action will push two additional commits into the `rc` branch. One is a change to `/projects/{$project}/CHANGELOG.md`, replacing `Unreleased` with the date of the dispatch.

The other is a service file `/projects/{$project}/.release-service` containing a random hash. This file only exists, so that there is a difference in case there is no Changelog.
